# MongoDB Synchronous Scala Driver

MongoDB Synchronous Scala Driver (mssd) is based on the plain old legacy [mongodb java driver](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/) and adds some Scala beauty to it.
It's similar to [casbash](http://mongodb.github.io/casbah/) but with a different api which was inspired by the [Play2 JSON API](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.0/ScalaJson) for the bson documents and by the [mongodb-async-driver](http://www.allanbank.com/mongodb-async-driver/index.html) for it's general API.

This driver is work in progress and not complete yet. Please feel free to contribute. It is used in production at [WebPageAnalyse](http://www.webpageanalyse.com) successfully.

## Installation and how to use it

Please have a look at the [project page](http://www.webpageanalyse.com/dev/mssd) to learn on how to install the driver
and with some simple use cases on how to use it.
